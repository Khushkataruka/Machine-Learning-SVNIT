If the data is already normalized, do not normalize. In most cases, normalization is required. You can apply any normalization technique. Split the dataset into train and test in 80:20 ratio. For classification task implement evaluation metrics of macro F1 scores and for regression tasks implement the evaluation metrics of MSE (mean squared error). You can implement any one of the below two questions. 

Implement a simple feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer and perform the classification task.

(or)

Implement a momentum based gradient descent algorithm for linear regression on the given dataset from scratch.
